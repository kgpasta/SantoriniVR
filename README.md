# SantoriniVR

Bugs:

* can place a worker at 5,5 (workermap is one unit too large)
* i think there's an issue in CanMove cuz sometimes if I move a worker to where another work has been..i think that's what happened... it won't let me move there - FIXED

Todo:

* Prashant
	* make worker objects climb levels
	* implement vr input for select phase

* Kaustubh
	* start implementing god power framework
